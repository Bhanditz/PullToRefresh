This library aims to provide a reusable Pull to Refresh widget for Adobe AIR mobile. It was based on Feathers (UI component of Starling Framework).
The inherited component is allowed to display a “loading” busy indicator at the top of the list and dispatch a event.

## Features

- Supports for Feathers (Version 1.1)
- Currently works with:
  - GroupedList (Inherit to: [feathers.controls.PullToRefreshGroupedList](https://github.com/duckleg/PullToRefresh/blob/master/src/feathers/controls/PullToRefreshGroupedList.as))
  - List (Inherit to: [feathers.controls.PullToRefreshList](https://github.com/duckleg/PullToRefresh/blob/master/src/feathers/controls/PullToRefreshList.as))

## What does work


First of all, you'll import the class path of the component
```as3
import feathers.controls.PullToRefreshList;
import feathers.controls.List;
````

Define a data set
```as3
var data:Array =
	[
		{ text: "Aardvark" },
		{ text: "Alligator" },
		{ text: "Alpaca" },
		{ text: "Anteater" },
	];
````

Create a PullToRefreshList
```as3
var list:List = new PullToRefreshList();
list.dataProvider = new ListCollection(data);
list.addEventListener(PullToRefreshList.PULL_TO_REFRESH_EVENT, listPullToRefreshHandler);
this.addChild(list);
````

If user pull down the component, you will receive a event
```as3
private function listPullToRefreshHandler(event:Event):void{
	...
	// call server to return some data
	...
}
````
